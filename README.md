# Pixy

An A.I. genetic learning algorithm implemented in Godot, with an accompanying 2D platformer. Supports player input, pool training and saving the current training progress and the best genome in the pool. Can be sped up around ~10x. See below for a screenshot and brief demo video.

Algorithm implemented is described in [Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
